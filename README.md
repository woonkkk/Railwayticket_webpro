## This project is a web application developed as part of the ITCS212 Web Programming course. 

It consists of two main phases:

:sparkles: Phase I focuses on designing webpages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is divided into sections for users and administrators, with various pages for each.

:sparkles: Phase II involves developing a web service using Node.js and integrating three databases for administration, login, and ticket information. Specific functions for administrators are implemented and protected by authentication. Additionally, real-time weather data and geolocation information are integrated into the homepage using WeatherAPI.com.

Overall, the project aims to create a functional website related to the Thailand railway, allowing users to access information and administrators to manage tickets and accounts securely
